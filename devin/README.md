# Clover for Devin

Brings Clover's silent plan review to **Devin** — the CLI ("Devin for Terminal")
and Devin Desktop, which run the same local agent and read the same config.
Installs through Devin's own plugin system and shares the `clover-hook` binary
and `bin/` tree with the Claude, Cursor and Kiro surfaces.

## Install

The plugin lives below the tree root, so the source carries a `#devin` suffix.

```bash
# beta (org ring)
devin plugins install clover-security-public/clover-security-marketplace-beta#devin -y

# public
devin plugins install clover-security-public/agentic-security-marketplace#devin -y

devin plugins info clover     # Hooks must list 3 entries
```

Without `#devin`, Devin resolves the tree root, finds the Claude
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and installs a plugin whose `Hooks` section is
empty — it registers cleanly and does nothing.

Then set credentials once (Clover Settings → API Tokens):

```bash
"$(devin plugins info clover | sed -n 's/^  source: //p')/scripts/configure.sh"
```

> **Workspace trust is required.** Devin ignores project config *and hooks* in an
> untrusted workspace, silently. The first `devin` run in a repo prompts to trust
> it — answer yes, or no hook ever fires. `/hooks` lists what actually loaded.

### Local validation

`scripts/local-install.sh` assembles the `clover-local` channel from the working
tree; install the Devin surface from it with a local path:

```bash
devin plugins install --local <assembled-tree>/devin -y
```

A local-path install symlinks to the source, so edits apply on the next session.

## How it maps to Devin

Devin's hooks are Claude-Code-compatible in shape but not vocabulary: tool names
are lowercase (`write`, `edit`, `exec`), `matcher` is a **regex over
`tool_name`**, and a block is `{"decision":"block","reason":…}` rather than
Claude's `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision`. The shim emits both dialects,
so a vocabulary change cannot silently turn the gate into a no-op.

| Devin event | Clover action | Claude equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | `setup` — deploy + verify binary | same |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `log-prompt` — prompt audit | same |
| `PreToolUse` (`write\|edit\|apply_patch`) | `review-write` — plan gate | `Edit\|Write\|MultiEdit` → `should-review-plan` |
| — | n/a: no `ExitPlanMode` tool | `ExitPlanMode` → `review-plan` |
| — | not wired (see **Updates**) | `SessionStart` → `check-update` |

`apply_patch` is in the matcher because Devin writes files through it too. It
carries a patch rather than a path, so the target is recovered from the patch
header (`*** Update/Add File:`, or a unified diff's `+++ b/`); without that the
gate fires, finds no path, and allows — which reads exactly like a reviewed write.

Devin exports `DEVIN_PLUGIN_ROOT` (and `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`)
to plugin hooks; `PLUGIN_ROOT` from the public docs is **not** set. Hook commands
resolve their root as
`${CLOVER_DEVIN_ROOT:-${DEVIN_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${DEVIN_PROJECT_DIR}/.devin/clover}}`,
so `CLOVER_DEVIN_ROOT` relocates the adapter for an org rollout without editing
the hooks file.

### Why the plan gate hangs off `.md` writes

Clover reviews *plan text*. Claude Code hands it over through the `ExitPlanMode`
tool input; Devin has no such tool, and its `/plan` approval is a UI action, not
a hook event. What Devin does expose is `PreToolUse` with a regex matcher, and
`write`/`edit` carry `file_path` + `content`.

That is the seam Claude Code's auto-mode already uses: intercept the `.md` write
and let the server classify whether the file is a plan (`should-review-plan`).
A plan the agent is about to commit to disk is reviewed before it lands; a
non-plan `.md` is waved through by the server's classifier; anything that is not
`.md` never leaves the shim.

## Provider equivalence

Devin's write/edit payloads were captured from a live session (Devin CLI
3000.6.2) and use the **same field names as Claude**:

| tool | `tool_input` |
|---|---|
| `write` | `file_path`, `content` |
| `edit` | `file_path`, `old_string`, `new_string` |

So both surfaces run the identical `resolveFileContent` reconstruction and send
the server the same text for the same change. `agent_devin_test.go` pins that
equivalence — a rename on either side fails the test rather than silently
changing what gets reviewed.

**The one real difference:** Claude has a second gate, `ExitPlanMode` →
`review-plan`, which reviews a plan the moment plan mode exits, even if it is
never written to disk. Devin has no `ExitPlanMode` tool and its `/plan` approval
is not a hook event, so on Devin a plan that is only discussed in chat and never
written to a `.md` is **not** reviewed. Anything written to a `.md` is gated
identically on both.

`apply_patch` is covered defensively: it is in the matcher and its header is
parsed for the target path, but Devin's model reached for `edit` in every
live capture, so that payload shape has not been observed in the wild.

## Windows

Every hook dispatches through `scripts/clover-hook.cmd`, a cmd/sh polyglot —
the same shape Cursor uses. Line 1 is a label to `cmd.exe` and an `exec` into
`setup.sh` / `run-hook.sh` for POSIX, so macOS and Linux behave exactly as if
the scripts were called directly.

On Windows there is no bash and no jq, so the batch half skips the shell
entirely and pipes the hook payload straight into the bundled `.exe`, which
speaks Devin's protocol natively through its `devin-setup`, `devin-log-prompt`
and `devin-review-write` subcommands (`cmd/clover-hook/agent_devin.go`). No hook
command names `bash` or a `.sh`, so nothing spawns a Git Bash console window on
every prompt. ARM64 falls back to the amd64 build, which Windows emulates.

`marketplace/tests/windows-support.sh` covers all of this.

## Updates

Devin has no equivalent of Claude's `check-update` hook, and none is wired here
on purpose: `devin plugins update clover` is the documented path, and running it
from inside a hook would mutate the plugin directory that the running hooks are
symlinked into. Refresh with:

```bash
devin plugins update clover
```

## Binary and channels

`setup.sh` mirrors `claude/scripts/setup.sh`: it deploys the binary bundled in
the tree's `bin/`, **verified against `bin/checksums.sha256`**, and refuses to
deploy on a missing manifest or a mismatch. There is no polling auto-update —
updates arrive when the marketplace re-syncs the tree. A release download is a
public-channel-only fallback, also checksum-verified.

Version and channel come from the tree's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, which the
assembly and carry-forward scripts stamp per channel.
`devin/.devin-plugin/plugin.json` carries a **display-only** version that CI does
not stamp; reading it for the deploy decision would pin every channel to a stale
snapshot and skip the redeploy a new beta build needs.

`setup.sh` also refuses a binary lacking the **`should-review-plan`** subcommand:
an older build exits `Unknown command`, the shim fails open on every write, and
the gate is silently absent rather than visibly broken.

## Delivery

This directory is the source of truth. Merging to `main` here publishes it to the
beta ring automatically (`.github/workflows/build-and-publish.yml`); the public
marketplace moves only via the manual promote. `devin/**` needs no mapping entry:
`plugins-touched-by.sh` routes anything unrecognised to `clover`, and
`scope-delivery-to-plugins.sh` gives `clover` ownership of everything outside the
two secondary plugin directories.

## Fail-open

Every hook path fails open: missing `jq`, a missing or unverifiable binary, auth
failure, an unparseable payload, or a server timeout all allow the write. The
gate blocks only on an explicit deny from the server.

## Debugging

- `CLOVER_DEBUG=1` — shim diagnostics on stderr.
- Binary log: `~/.devin/clover/.clover-hook.log`.
- `/hooks` inside Devin — shows which hooks loaded and from where.
- `hooks/discover.hooks.v1.json` — install as `.devin/hooks.v1.json` to log every
  event's full stdin payload to `/tmp/clover-devin-hook.log` and never block.
- `CLOVER_HOOK_BIN=/path/to/stub` — swap the binary to exercise the block path.

## Server side

`codingAgent: "Devin"` is already a member of the backend's `CodingAgentType`
enum (`Infrastructure/Entities/Enums/CodingAgentType.cs`), so review and audit
rows attribute correctly with no backend change.
