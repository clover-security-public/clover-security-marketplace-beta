# Deploys the clover-hook binary bundled with the plugin tree, verified against
# the tree's checksum manifest. Mirrors claude/scripts/setup.sh — same integrity
# gate, same channel model — with the paths Devin gives a plugin.
#
# Layout: Devin installs this directory (`<tree>/devin`) as the plugin, so the
# shared binaries and their manifest sit one level up in `<tree>/bin`. Version
# and channel come from the tree's own .claude-plugin/plugin.json, which is what
# the assembly and carry-forward scripts stamp per channel — devin's
# .devin-plugin/plugin.json version is display-only and is NOT stamped, so
# reading it here would pin every channel to a stale snapshot and skip the
# redeploy a new beta build needs.
#
# There is no polling auto-update: updates arrive by the marketplace re-syncing
# the tree, exactly as on Claude. Polling public releases from a beta install
# would deploy a build that never soaked in the ring.
