rem Line 1 is a polyglot: cmd.exe reads it as a label and skips to the batch
rem below, while a POSIX shell executes it and execs the existing setup.sh /
rem run-hook.sh THROUGH BASH (they use pipefail, a bashism dash rejects), so
rem macOS and Linux behaviour is byte-identical to calling those scripts
rem directly. cmd.exe never executes line 1, so the bash there is unreachable
rem on Windows. The trailing "#" swallows the CR of the CRLF endings cmd.exe
rem requires.
rem
rem On Windows the shell scripts cannot run -- no bash, no jq -- so the hook
rem payload goes straight to the bundled executable, which speaks Devin's
rem protocol natively via its devin-* subcommands. Devin pipes the payload in
rem on stdin; cmd hands its stdin to the child unchanged.

rem Devin sets DEVIN_PLUGIN_ROOT to the plugin directory (<tree>\devin), so the
rem shared bin\ is one level up. %~dp0..\.. is the same place, script-relative,
rem for the case where the variable is absent.
