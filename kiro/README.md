# Clover for Kiro

Clover security review inside [Kiro](https://kiro.dev), AWS's spec-driven
agentic IDE (and the Kiro CLI). Same binary and same `/Hooks/*` backend as the
Claude Code and Cursor surfaces — only the event plumbing differs, and it lives
in `cmd/clover-hook/agent_kiro.go`, not in these scripts.

## Why Kiro fits

Kiro writes its plan to disk as a **spec** —
`.kiro/specs/<feature>/{requirements,bugfix,design,tasks}.md` — and runs tasks
from it, firing a **blocking `PreTaskExec`** immediately before implementation.
That gives Clover a real plan artifact plus the closest analogue to Claude's
`ExitPlanMode` gate on any non-Claude agent.

| Trigger | Subcommand | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `kiro-log-prompt` | no |
| `PostFileSave` on `.kiro/specs/**/*.md` | `kiro-capture-spec` | no |
| `PreTaskExec` | `kiro-pre-task` | **yes** |

Kiro's decision contract is the exit code, not JSON: exit 0 proceeds (stdout is
appended to the model's context), a non-zero exit blocks and hands **stderr** to
the model. There is no "allow" to emit, so the "decision only when blocking"
invariant holds by silence. Because *any* non-zero exit blocks, every error path
exits 0.

## Install

One command, once per machine — it covers every repository via Kiro's global
`~/.kiro/hooks/` path, downloads only the binary for the current platform
(checksum-verified), and prompts for the two credential values:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clover-security-public/agentic-security-marketplace/main/kiro/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

To install into a single repository instead (the drop-in a team commits to
git so cloning developers get the hooks with no install step):

```bash
curl -fsSL .../kiro/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- /path/to/repo
```

The script also runs from a local checkout of the marketplace tree, copying
instead of downloading. `CLOVER_MARKETPLACE_URL` overrides the download base
(the beta ring's raw URL, or a mirror). Layout after a machine-wide install:

```
~/.kiro/
  hooks/clover.json              # the three hooks above, absolute-path commands
  clover/
    scripts/run-hook.sh          # resolves the platform binary, loads env.sh, exec
    bin/clover-hook-<os>-<arch>
    env.sh                       # credentials — prompted, 0600, never committed
```

Credentials can also be pre-provisioned by dropping `env.sh` in place (MDM,
dotfiles) — the installer never overwrites an existing one.

Then open a repo in Kiro and **trust the workspace** — an untrusted workspace
silently turns every hook into a no-op, logged only at debug level. Confirm
with the Output panel → Kiro agent channel:
`[KiroAgent] v2 hooks loaded 3 standalone hooks from .kiro/hooks/`.

## When a new Kiro build changes its payload

Field naming has changed between builds and `PreTaskExec`'s shape is
undocumented, so the adapter accepts every spelling seen so far (`file_path`,
`filePath`, `path`, `spec_path`, `specPath`, `tool_input.specPath`) and falls
back to the most recently modified spec directory when an event names none. A
rename is therefore additive rather than breaking.

To see what a new build actually sends, run with `CLOVER_DEBUG=1` and read the
diagnostics log — the adapter records the event name and the spec it resolved.

## Known constraints

- **The IDE delivers an empty `prompt`**
  ([kirodotdev/Kiro#7500](https://github.com/kirodotdev/Kiro/issues/7500)), so
  prompt audit is a no-op there and posts nothing rather than a blank row; the
  CLI delivers the real text. Spec review is unaffected — the plan is read from
  disk.
- **Kiro does not close the hook's stdin.** A read to EOF hangs the turn until
  the hook times out, so Kiro's subcommands set `readsOneJSONValue` and stop at
  the end of the payload.
- **Every hook renders a chat card.** Kiro emits it at the engine level before
  the command runs; no setting or schema field suppresses it. All hooks are
  named `Clover Security`, the command and its output are never rendered, and
  the card collapses to a one-line summary when the turn ends.
- **Spec tasks can run concurrently**, so `PreTaskExec` may fire in parallel.
  The approved-plan-hash short-circuit in `runPlanReview` dedupes the common
  case.
- **`CodingAgentType` has no `Kiro` member** in Leaf yet, and the endpoints
  reject an unknown enum string, so activity is recorded as `Other`. Set
  `CLOVER_KIRO_CODING_AGENT=Kiro` (or change `kiroDefaultCodingAgent`) in the
  same release that adds the enum value.
- **Powers cannot carry hooks.** Kiro's power installer copies only `POWER.md`,
  `mcp.json` and `steering/`. A Clover *power* can ship steering and an MCP
  server; the hooks ship as this drop-in.

## The companion power

`clover-power/` is the Kiro *power* half of the surface: steering that teaches
the agent to honor Clover's review verdicts and `.clover-requirements.md`
files. Kiro installs powers straight from a Git URL — a subdirectory works via
a `/tree/<branch>/<path>` link — so once this tree is delivered to a
marketplace repo, install it with:

1. Command palette → **Powers: Configure** → **Import power from GitHub**.
2. Paste the marketplace URL for this directory, e.g. for the beta ring:
   `https://github.com/clover-security-public/clover-security-marketplace-beta/tree/main/kiro/clover-power`

The installer copies only `POWER.md` and `steering/` and registers the power as
`clover-power` (Kiro derives the name from the last path segment). The beta
marketplace repo is private, so the clone authenticates through your local git
credentials; the public marketplace URL needs none.

The power is optional and additive: the hooks enforce, the power only improves
how the agent responds to an enforcement. It ships no MCP server yet — Kiro's
remote-MCP auth against the Clover streaming endpoint is untested, and a
failing MCP entry would make the whole power look broken.

## Debugging

`CLOVER_DEBUG=1` in `env.sh` for diagnostics, `CLOVER_KIRO_OBSERVE=1` to
downgrade the `PreTaskExec` gate to observe-only during a staged rollout, and
`CLOVER_HOOK_BIN` to point at a locally built binary.
